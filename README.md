dogstatsd-python
================

A DogStatsd Python client.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/DataDog/dogstatsd-python.png)](http://travis-ci.org/DataDog/dogstatsd-python)

Quick Start Guide
-----------------

First install the library with `pip` or `easy_install`

    # Install in system python ...
    sudo easy_install dogstatsd-python

    # .. or into a virtual env
    easy_install  dogstatsd-python

Then start instrumenting your code:

``` python
# Import the module.
from statsd import statsd

# Optionally, configure the host and port if you're running Statsd on a
# non-standard port.
statsd.connect('localhost', 8125)

# Increment a counter.
statsd.increment('page.views')

# Record a gauge 50% of the time.
statsd.gauge('users.online', 123, sample_rate=0.5)

# Sample a histogram.
statsd.histogram('file.upload.size', 1234)

# Time a function call.
@statsd.timed('page.render')
def render_page():
    # Render things ...

# Tag a metric.
statsd.histogram('query.time', 10, tags = ["version:1"])
```
You can also post events to your stream. You can tag them, set priority and even aggregate them with other events.

Aggregation in the stream is made on hostname/event_type/source_type/aggregation_key.

``` python
# Post a simple message
statsd.event("There might be a storm tomorrow", "A friend warned me earlier.")

# Cry for help
statsd.event("SO MUCH SNOW", "Started yesterday and it won't stop !!", alert_type = "error", tags = ["urgent", "endoftheworld"])
```
